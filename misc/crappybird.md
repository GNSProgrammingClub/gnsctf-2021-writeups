When you die there is an option to go to the shop. Inside the shop there is a flag that you can buy.
After some fiddling around with the program we find the import export feature. This holds our save data and can be modified.
If we try changing the items we bought and our coins by playing the game and looking at the result on the save data we quickly figure out that the last digits of our save state determine the items we own.
A 1 means we have that item and a 0 means we don't. We can set the last 4 digits to 1 in the save state and import to get the flag.

Flag: `gnsCTF{50on_7o_b3_r3mov3d}`
