First we have to figure out what a human is. This is crucial as the problem is supposedly easy for humans. Google defines this as "a human being, especially a person as distinguished from an animal or (in science fiction) an alien." As such we know that this challenge will involve tricking the challenge server into believing that we are not penguins. Unfortunately penguins are easily distinguishable by their physical characteristics such as their bill, flippers, and feathers. They also live in vastly different conditions which may result in us having to use a vpn like NORDVPN to hide the fact that we are 10,000 miles away from human society. Btw we live in a society. The solution is trivial though; with NordVPN you can protect your privacy from prying eyes with military-grade encryption. Buy Nord VPN today using the promo code in the description down below for 55% off one year subscription! Ok now that we have NordVPN we need to be able to type the flag into the website. Unfortunately penguins do not have opposable thumbs which will make it impossible for us to type in such a flag. We can instead harness the energy of the sun to create cosmic rays that flip bits in our supercooled antarctic supercomputer. Through penguin ingenuity and expertise in astronomy and physics, along with computer science, we can flip bits in a precise manner to type out the flag and send it to the server.

Flag: `gnsCTF{n0t_s0_1ns4n3}`
